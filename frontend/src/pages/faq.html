    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is DeepScan?</dt>
      <dd>DeepScan is an AI-powered web tool that extracts, analyzes, and rewrites your Resume to make it ATS-friendly and tailored to your target role. You can also build a Resume from scratch using the Resume Builder with live preview and exports.</dd>

      <dt>How do I upload my Resume?</dt>
      <dd>Click “Choose File,” upload your Resume in PDF or DOCX format, and then click “Upload and Extract Text.” Review the extracted text and click “Rewrite Resume.”</dd>

      <dt>Can I just paste my Resume instead of uploading?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. Paste your Resume text into the textarea on the Home page and skip the file-upload step entirely.</dd>

      <dt>What “field of work” should I enter?</dt>
      <dd>Enter the industry or role you’re targeting (e.g., “Software Engineering,” “Data Science,” “Help Desk”). This guides the rewrite toward the right keywords and phrasing.</dd>

      <dt>How long does it take?</dt>
      <dd>Extraction typically finishes in a few seconds. The AI rewrite usually returns within 5–15 seconds depending on Resume length and server load.</dd>

      <dt>Is my data secure?</dt>
      <dd>Uploaded files are stored only temporarily for parsing and then deleted. Communication uses HTTPS. Resume Builder drafts saved in your browser never leave your device.</dd>

      <dt>Do I need an account or pay to use DeepScan?</dt>
      <dd>No. During our beta, access is free and does not require an account.</dd>

      <dt>Can I revert or review changes?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. Your original text remains in the textarea. The rewritten version appears below so you can compare, edit, and copy your final result.</dd>

      <dt>What if something looks wrong?</dt>
      <dd>If extraction looks off (e.g., from an image-only PDF), try exporting your Resume as a true text PDF/DOCX or paste the text directly. You can also refine the “field of work.”</dd>

      <dt>Does DeepScan work for non-English Resumes?</dt>
      <dd>Not yet. Current enhancement is English-only.</dd>

      <dt>Does DeepScan assist with cover letters?</dt>
      <dd>Not in this version. Cover-letter help is planned for the future.</dd>

      <dt>What’s the difference between the Home page AI and the Resume Builder?</dt>
      <dd>The Home page is ideal if you already have a Resume and a defined target role; it extracts and rewrites your content. The Resume Builder is ideal for creating a Resume from scratch with structured sections, live preview, and export options.</dd>

      <dt>What can I do in the Resume Builder?</dt>
      <dd>Add Experience, Education, and Projects; enter Skills as chips; edit a Professional Summary; live-preview the layout; and use actions like Save Draft, Load Draft, Export/Import JSON, and Download PDF (prints the preview pane).</dd>

      <dt>How do I save and continue later?</dt>
      <dd>Click “Save Draft” to store your data in your browser’s local storage. Later, click “Load Draft” on the same device/browser. You can also Export JSON and Import JSON to move between devices.</dd>

      <dt>How do I download my Resume as a PDF?</dt>
      <dd>Use “Download PDF” in Resume Builder. It prints only the preview area for a clean, ready-to-share PDF.</dd>

      <dt>What does “Build with DeepSeek (beta)” do?</dt>
      <dd>It sends your current builder data to the backend to enhance sections like Summary or Skills. If the backend isn’t reachable, you’ll see a notice—try again later or proceed without it.</dd>

      <dt>Which file types are supported for upload?</dt>
      <dd>PDF and DOCX for file uploads; plain text for paste-in. Image-only PDFs aren’t supported—export to text-based PDF/DOCX or paste the text.</dd>

      <dt>Troubleshooting uploads & extraction</dt>
      <dd>If uploads fail or return empty text, refresh and try again, verify the file is text-based, or paste your Resume. Persistent issues? Send us details on the Contact Us page.</dd>

      <dt>Where can I send feedback or report a bug?</dt>
      <dd>Use the Contact Us page and include steps to reproduce and any screenshots. We appreciate it!</dd>
