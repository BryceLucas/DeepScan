    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We are group of dedicated students from CSI4999, Oakland University. Members: Aidan Chapman, Bryce Lucas, Andrae Taylor, Kole Micakaj, and Michael Lafata. Our group consist of Seniors at looking to create something unique for our final few semesters at Oakland University.

    <p>
      Our project is a web-based chatbot application focused on resume enhancement, designed to help users improve their resumes through an intuitive and conversational AI experience. All of us have had experience using a chatbot like chatgpt or google gemini. Most users don't know how to customize these chat bots to get the best(most accurate results) results in which a project like DeepScan simplifies this process for all users.
    <p>
      Many of our fellow peers will be looking to enhance their resumes going into the workforce out of graduation and a tool like DeepScan is the perfect way to accomplish that. By integrating DeepSeek (an open source LLM) we can provide a cost effective and intelligent feedback agent to enhance resumes rather than paying for a  service like ChatGPT. Users can upload their resumes and input a target job title which DeepScan uses to tailor its output for the desired sector the user specializes in.
