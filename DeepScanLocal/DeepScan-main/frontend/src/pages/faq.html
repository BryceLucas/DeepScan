    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is DeepScan?</dt>
      <dd>DeepScan is an AI-powered web tool that extracts, analyzes, and rewrites your résumé to make it ATS-friendly and tailored to your target role.</dd>

      <dt>How do I upload my résumé?</dt>
      <dd>Click “Choose File,” upload your résumé in a PDF or DOCX format, and then click "Upload and Extract Text." Our backend parses out all the text so you can review and then click “Rewrite Resume.”</dd>

      <dt>Can I just paste my résumé instead of uploading?</dt>
      <dd>Yes! You can paste your résumé text directly into the text area and skip the file-upload step entirely.</dd>

      <dt>What “field of work” should I enter?</dt>
      <dd>Enter the industry or role you’re targeting (e.g., “Software Engineering,” “Data Science”). This helps DeepScan customize phrasing and keywords for your specific field.</dd>

      <dt>How long does it take?</dt>
      <dd>Text extraction completes in a few seconds. The AI rewrite typically takes under 15 seconds depending on server load and résumé length.</dd>

      <dt>Is my data secure?</dt>
      <dd>Uploaded files are stored only temporarily on our server, immediately parsed, and then deleted. We don’t keep copies of your résumé and all communication is encrypted over HTTPS.</dd>

      <dt>Do I need an account or pay to use DeepScan?</dt>
      <dd>No signup or payment is required for our beta. We use an open-source LLM (DeepSeek) to keep costs low and access entirely free during development.</dd>

      <dt>Can I revert or review changes?</dt>
      <dd>Yes after extraction you see your original text in the textarea. The rewritten résumé appears below so you can compare before copying your final version.</dd>

      <dt>What if something looks wrong?</dt>
      <dd>If the extracted text is garbled or the rewrite isn’t what you expected, please try rephrasing your “field of work” or paste your text instead. We’re continuously improving our parsing and prompts!</dd>
     
      <dt>Does DeepScan work for non-English résumés?</dt>
      <dd>No, the current version of DeepScan does not enhance résumés that are not in English.</dd>

      <dt>Does DeepScan assist with cover letter writing?</dt>
      <dd>No, the current version of DeepScan does not enhance cover letters, however, it is a feature planned for the future.</dd>

      <dt>What is the difference from the homepage resume ai and the resume builder page?</dt>
      <dd>The homepage version of our DeepScan ai focuses on users who have a resume and a defined career path. Resume Builder focuses more on users who don't have a resume or are less sure on their career path and direction and have prior work experience.</dd>
